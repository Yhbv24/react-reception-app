# R/West Reception App (React)
#### By Ash Laidlaw

## About

This is a React web app that is meant for office reception areas. The app allows guests (deliveries, friends, etc.) to check in by choosing who they need to visit from the list. It will send a message to that person on Slack, but if that person is offline, it will send an email to that person's email address associated with Slack.. Its purpose is to simplify check-in for office visitors in an easy way.
